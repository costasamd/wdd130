        <p>Hello! My name is Samuel Dias Costa. I am from Brazil, but I lived in Spain and currently
            I am living in UK with my family. I have my wife and two children that supports me and they bring
            joy and excitement to my life. We enjoy hiking and some quite time too.
            I join BYU after closing my business as PT and after a long pondering (about the new direction that
            I should take in life). I love the surprises that life throws at me, even though they are not always easy to face.
