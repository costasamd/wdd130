        <p>Hello! My name is Samuel Dias Costa. I am from Brazil, but I lived in Spain and currently
            I am living in UK with my family. I have my wife and two children that supports me and they bring
            joy and excitement to my life. We enjoy hiking and some quite time too.
            I join BYU after closing my business as PT and after a long pondering (about the new direction that
            I should take in life). I love the surprises that life throws at me, even though they are not always easy to face.
            One thing that always help is my belif in God as my Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as my Savior.
            In the Temple I can find peace and answer for my doubts and uncertanties, I know I don't need to go through the hard
            moments of life on my own, with my family here, wife and kids, and also with my Heavenly Father I can overcome anything
        </p>

        <p>Manchester is a lovely city, the second biggest in England, just losing for London. It's famous for the BBC tv and it's big range of universities,
            Manchester center is full of young people from many different countries that comes here to study. It's in the north west of UK which means cheaper life style,
            but also much more rain and cloud days.
